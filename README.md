# Enhancing Open-Set Speaker Identification through Rapid Tuning with Speaker Reciprocal Points and Negative Samples

## Overview
This project introduces an innovative approach to open-set speaker identification, leveraging rapid tuning techniques with speaker reciprocal points and the strategic use of negative samples. By refining the identification process, our method achieves significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency, setting a new benchmark in speaker recognition technology.

## Dataset
We utilize two primary datasets in our research:
- **Snapdragon**: (Here, provide a brief description of the Snapdragon dataset, including its characteristics and why it's suitable for this research.)
- **HeyMiya**: (Provide details about the HeyMiya dataset, highlighting its unique features and contribution to the research.)
